# Security Policy

ZeraLabs builds privacy and cryptographic infrastructure. We take security seriously.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Do not open a public issue for security vulnerabilities.**

If you discover a security vulnerability in any ZeraLabs project, please report it responsibly:

1. Email **team@zeralabs.org** with a detailed description.
2. Include steps to reproduce the issue, potential impact, and any suggested fixes.
3. Allow reasonable time for us to investigate and patch before any public disclosure.

We will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours and provide a timeline for resolution.

## Scope

This policy covers all repositories under the [ZeraLabs](https://github.com/zeralabs) GitHub organization, including but not limited to:

- ZERA Protocol (smart contracts, proof circuits, cryptographic primitives)
- ZERA Wallet
- Developer SDK and tooling

## What Qualifies

- Cryptographic weaknesses in proof systems or commitment schemes
- Smart contract vulnerabilities (reentrancy, access control, fund drainage)
- Privacy leaks that could deanonymize users or reveal transaction details
- Key management or authentication bypasses
- Dependency vulnerabilities with demonstrable impact

## Recognition

We credit researchers who responsibly disclose valid vulnerabilities (unless anonymity is preferred).
