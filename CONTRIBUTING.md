# Contributing to ZeraLabs

Thanks for your interest in contributing to ZeraLabs. We're building open-source zero-knowledge privacy infrastructure and contributions of all kinds are welcome.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

- Use the issue tracker on the relevant repository.
- Search existing issues before opening a new one.
- Include reproduction steps, expected behavior, and actual behavior.
- For security vulnerabilities, see our [Security Policy](SECURITY.md) instead.

### Submitting Changes

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a feature branch from `main` (`git checkout -b feat/your-feature`).
3. Make your changes with clear, focused commits.
4. Ensure tests pass and add tests for new functionality.
5. Open a pull request with a description of what changed and why.

### Branch Naming

- `feat/` — New features
- `fix/` — Bug fixes
- `docs/` — Documentation changes
- `refactor/` — Code restructuring without behavior changes
- `test/` — Test additions or improvements

### Commit Messages

Write clear, concise commit messages. Use the imperative mood ("Add feature" not "Added feature"). Reference issue numbers where applicable.

## Development Setup

Each repository has its own setup instructions in its README. Follow those to get a local development environment running.

## Code Review

All submissions require review before merging. Maintainers may request changes — this is a normal part of the process. We aim to review PRs within a few days.

## Code of Conduct

All contributors are expected to follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Be respectful, constructive, and collaborative.
