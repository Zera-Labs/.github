# ZeraLabs

**ZK layer turning your crypto into true digital cash: private transfers, shielded balances & offline P2P.**

We build open-source privacy protocols and tools that enable secure, anonymous transactions on Solana — powered by Pedersen Commitments, zk-SNARKs, and nullifier-based double-spend prevention.

## What We Build

- **ZERA Protocol** — Token-agnostic privacy protocol for anonymous digital cash transactions. Works across USDC, USDT, SOL, and more without synthetic bridges or intermediary tokens.
- **ZERA Wallet** — Privacy-enabled wallet with shielded balances, offline P2P transfers, and private swaps.
- **Developer SDK** — Infrastructure and tooling for building privacy-focused applications on top of ZERA.

## Research Areas

Our work sits at the intersection of applied cryptography and blockchain systems:

- Zero-knowledge proof systems (zk-SNARKs)
- Commitment schemes and confidential transactions
- Privacy-preserving token transfers across multiple asset types
- Secure hardware and biometric authentication for key management
